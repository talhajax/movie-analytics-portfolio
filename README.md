# movie-analytics-portfolio
A Portfolio project showcasing movie analytics using TMDB database.     

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies
This dataset contains metadeta for thousands of movies listed in TMDB site, including budget, revenue, popularity, runtime, vote average, vote count, and more.

## Project Structure
- `MoviesComplexAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis.
- visualisation : You can view the interactive dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/TMDBMoviesData/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Following is a comprehensive list of all the libraries you need to install:

1. **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. **numpy**: For numerical operations.
3. **seaborn**: For data visualization.
4. **matplotlib**: For plotting graphs.
5. **wordcloud**: For generating word clouds from text data.
6. **nltk**: For natural language processing, specifically the VADER sentiment analyzer.
7. **scikit-learn**: For machine learning, including model building, evaluation, and preprocessing.
8. **dash**: For creating interactive web applications.
9. **plotly**: For interactive graphing.
10. **random**: For generating random numbers.
11. **CountVectorizer** and **cosine_similarity** from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` and `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`, respectively, for text vectorization and similarity calculations.

Here are the installation commands for these libraries:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install wordcloud
pip install nltk
pip install scikit-learn
pip install dash
pip install plotly
```

You can install all of them at once by running:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib wordcloud nltk scikit-learn dash plotly
```

Ensure that you have these libraries installed in your Python environment to execute the provided code successfully.
